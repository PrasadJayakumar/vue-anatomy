# Purpose of the App

Vue JS is down-to-earth codebase. Easily this be would be my goto Open Source codebase to improve my JavaScript skills.  Vue anatomy is my attempt to decode the simple but powerful library+framework.  I hope my approach would help JavaScript developers - both beginners and experts to learn Vue and eventually to become a contributor as well. 

PS: I am doing my preparations to become a Vue contributor
